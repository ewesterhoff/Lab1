2 major slices
optimize add / sub togther




how:
whiteboard it
	how to build the xor and slt bits (30 mins)
	optimize system as a whole? (30 mins)
Divy up into major sections
	

Implementation (4 hours)
Build small pieces (based on what we whiteboard)
Put them together

Test bench
(simultaneous w/implementation)
Outline test cases (30 mins)
Putting test cases into verilog (30 mins)
